        The Minodes GmbH developed a Wifi-based analysis tool to evaluate customer flows at trade fairs, markets and in department
        stores ("in-store analytics") and make these available to customers (retailers, event organizers). This tool was later 
        combined with IMSI data from the Telefonica network.

        During my internship, my tasks consisted of getting to know all the backend services and implementing simple bug fixes and feature tickets. Furthermore, I dealt with small tickets related to the hardware that was installed in stored to record the Wifi signals.
