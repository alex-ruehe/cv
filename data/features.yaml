  details: |
    7 years of experience in designing, developing, and operating data processing platforms with a focus on speed and scalability in challenging environments both on-prem and in AWS.

    As a Backend Engineer, Data Engineer and technical lead, I have successfully architected, built, and operated secure products across various domains, such as

    - Visitor flow analysis in retail stores using WiFi signals
    - Mobility data analysis derived from anonymized IMSI data
    - Vehicle sensor data processing

    I have also multiple years of experience in stakeholder management, documenting architecture, technical interviews and mentoring. Always interested in exploring new domains and specializations and a big fan of learning by doing.
