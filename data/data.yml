    Ich habe sechs Jahre Erfahrung im Aufbau von skalierbaren Architekturen zur Datenverarbeitung sowohl auf on-prem als auch auf Cloud-Umgebungen. Beim Design und der Planung von Architekturen bevorzuge ich Einfachheit und Bewährtes statt immer die neuesten Technologien einzusetzen. Meine Stärken liegen darin, zu verstehen, was Stakeholder brauchen, bevor sie es selber wissen.
